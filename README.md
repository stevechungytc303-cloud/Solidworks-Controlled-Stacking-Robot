# Solidworks-Controlled-Stacking-Robot
This project extracts pick-up and drop-off coordinates from two SolidWorks Assembly files: one showing the robot‚Äôs starting environment and one showing the final stacked layout. Macros created using the SolidWorks API extract the coordinates and generate a temporary PowerShell script. The script sends the data to the computer port connected to the robot‚Äôs Arduino, which moves the robot accordingly.
## Robot Info
- **Kinematics**: Uses a coordinate system and inverse kinematics to calculate reachable positions
- **Gearboxes**: Three custom 1:20 cycloidal gearboxes provide high torque and compact form factor
- **Payload Capacity**: Supports up to 5‚ÄØkg of stacked weight within an 80‚ÄØcm diameter workspace, using a vacuum suction mechanism for reliable pick-and-place operations
