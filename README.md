# Solidworks-Controlled-Stacking-Robot
This project extracts pick-up and drop-off coordinates from two SolidWorks Assembly files: one showing the robot’s starting environment and one showing the final stacked layout. Macros created using the SolidWorks API extract the coordinates and generate a temporary PowerShell script. The script sends the data to the computer port connected to the robot’s Arduino, which moves the robot accordingly.
